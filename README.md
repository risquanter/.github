# Introduction

**Risquanter** is an evolving initiative with the ambition to transform cybersecurity risk assessment, with a focus on product risk.  
We aim to **make cyber risk quantification a ubiquitous part of cybersecurity**, moving it beyond spreadsheets and into enterprise‑ready tools and services.  
Our vision is to empower both practitioners and solution providers to adopt quantitative methods more seamlessly.  

While still in its early stages, this ambition guides our work toward building practical, scalable tooling and enterprise-ready solutions that move beyond ad‑hoc solutions like Excel plugins.
